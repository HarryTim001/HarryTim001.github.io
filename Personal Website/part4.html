            like. Considering his chance, Jason tries to find out more about the secret plan to reveal it to Hoyt. Only
            then he will have the chance to meet Hoyt who will thank him in person. In Hoyt's base, Jason meets someone
            unexpected...</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>I love Far Cry 3. It's one of the very first PC games that I played. But it will be one of the last games I
            will forget. It showed me what a good video game is. Compelling characters, a great plot, fun gameplay, many
            enjoyable side activities to do, and many more; these things make Far Cry 3 truly one of the best games of
            all time. I hope everyone who contributed to the making of Far Cry 3 is living their best lives knowing that
            they created such a masterpeice. I'm also glad that I now have someone to whom I've told about this
            fantastic game. Thank you ivy, for journeying with me through this insanity. Now, did I ever tell you about
            the definition of Insanity?</p>
