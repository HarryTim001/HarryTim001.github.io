        <p>Far Cry 3 is a first-person shooter set on the fictional Rook Islands, a tropical archipelago somewhere in
            the
            Pacific, controlled by pirates and mercenaries. It was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by
            Ubisoft.
            It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2012.</p>
        <p>The game received critical acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its characters (particularly Vaas),
            world design, visuals, progression, and gameplay, though the game's multiplayer modes received criticism.

            including Game of the Year and Best Shooter awards by several gaming publications. It has also been cited as
