                <p>Far Cry 3 is a 2012 first-person shooter game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft.
                    It
                    is the third main installment in the Far Cry series after Far Cry 2. The game takes place on the
                    fictional Rook Islands, a tropical archipelago which can be freely explored by players. Gameplay
                    focuses
                    on combat and exploration. Players can use a variety of weapons to defeat human enemies and hostile
                    wildlife, and the game features elements found in role-playing games such as skill trees and
                    experience.
                    After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save his friends, who have been kidnapped
                    by
                    pirates, and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants.</p>

                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>Jason Brody (Gianpaolo Venuta) is on vacation with a group of friends in the fictional Rook Islands
                    between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, celebrating his younger brother Riley (Alex Harrouch)
                    receiving a pilot's license. On a skydiving trip, they unknowingly land on a pirate-occupied island
                    and are captured by pirate lord Vaas Montenegro (Michael Mando), who intends to sell them into
                    slavery. Jason escapes with help from his older brother Grant (Lane Edwards), who is killed by Vaas.
                    Jason is rescued by Dennis (Charles Malik Whitfield), an adopted member of the islands' native
                    Rakyat tribe. Dennis recognizes Jason's potential as a warrior and gives him the Tatau, the tattoos
                    of a Rakyat warrior.</p>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>The team avoided creating distinct levels. As opposed to traditional game design in which designers
                    carefully calculated where and how to place environmental objects on a grid the team instead
                    experimented with dynamic cover design and utilized an algorithm provided by the Dunia Engine to
                    quickly procedural generate the layout of a large area. The team would then manually adjust the
                    placement of different objects and test the output. By avoiding repeating patterns, this enabled the
                    world to be unpredictable and realistic, and allowed dynamic wildlife and enemy encounters to remain
                    fresh even when players explore the same area again. Spaces are created to be logical and grounded.
                    For instance, some enemy outposts are sites of industries, crucial for the pirates to operate at
                    Rook Islands. The team wanted players to believe that the spaces they explore "[exist] for a reason"
                    within the game not merely for gameplay purposes and these efforts at creating a civilization helped
                    increase the game world's credibility. When creating the world's space, the game was inspired by The
                    Elder Scrolls series and Red Dead Redemption in how these series reward players with progression.
                    However, the team wished to avoid repetitiveness in gameplay, and created over 250 different hostile
                    encounters and a system that remembers each encounter and only recycle it after extended play. The
                    team believed that this helped raise the diversity of the experience.
                    <br><br>
                    The team evaluated the gameplay elements from Far Cry 2 and determined which gameplay elements they
                    should include or improve. Weapon degradation and malaria infection were removed as the team thought
                    that it made the game less fun. According to producer Dan Hay, Far Cry 2's world was barren and
                    lacked reactions to players' actions. Therefore, the team decided to make the world more lively with
                    the goal of creating "an actual civilization" for players to encounter. In Far Cry 3, players'
                    actions impact the game's world, with Vaas's influence gradually reducing after Jason liberates a
                    hostile camp. The world of Rook Islands was designed to be filled with opportunities and
                    activities for players, enticing them into exploring so that they would not feel bored while
                    traveling within the game's world. The team introduced side quests which allow players to learn more
                    about the history and inhabitants of the islands. The world was designed to be empowering, so that
                    players were free to do what they wanted in the world without being hurried into completing the main
                    quests. The team also attempted to increase the accessibility of travel by improving the game's
                    driving mechanics and introducing fast travel points. Within each mission, players can freely
                    choose their playstyle, whether they choose to eliminate enemies using stealth or firepower, Hay
                    believing that the game respects players' choices. He also believed the team had crafted a
                    meaningful open world, and Rook Island was considered to be the "second most important
                    character". According to Jamie Keen, the game's lead designer, the world was both "alluring and
                    repulsive" and players will "feel seduced by the place and all the people in it". Inspirations were
                    taken from media including Apocalypse Now and Lost. The team decided to return to an island
                    setting, like the first Far Cry, as a narrative decision made during the game's early development.
                    The team believed that the setting mashed well with the story they wanted to create, enabled them to
                    create a world filled with variety, and helped inspire a sense of isolation and discovery.
